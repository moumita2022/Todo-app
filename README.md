## MERN-APP
### TO-DO APP

- Full stack application using MERN stack.
- We want to deploy as one app on heroku in future.
- Structure ,Need to take care of the structure of the application.

Our plan is to have our server inside the main MERN-APP folder and client as sub folder insde the   MERN-APP folder.
We need to send the static files when user is accessing our app(because react-build will create a build folder that will contain all of our work as static files).

## Functionalities of our App
- Registration with email and password.And with hashing the password.
- Sign-in
- React-router-dom
- State Management / Context API
- axios/ fetch

## Backend
- Basic express server
- Mongoose Connection
- Routes

- Models
- Hashing password
- Authentication(check password and email are correct)/ Token creation
- Authorization(verify token and authorize user to access the inbox routes)/ Token verification
- Database MongoDB
